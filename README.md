# MovieDatabaseQuery
Given a .csv file containing IMDB movie information of about 5000 movies, this program creates a movie database by reading the data
in to an array. It then allows the user to input any of the following search indexes:
*year
*movie_title
*color
*duration
*director_name
*actor_name
*movie_imdb_link
*language
*country
*content_rating
*imdb_score

The user can then generate queries by combining one or more of the following queries:
*and
*or
*not
*greater than or equal to
*less than or equal to
*greater than
*less than
*equal to
*not equal to

The query is then executed using the indexing trees and the resulting list of movies and their information is printed out.

##Sample Query and Corresponding Output

Query query = new And(new Equal("color", "Black and White"), new GT("imdb_score", 8.0));
